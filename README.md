# Linear-Regression-Weekly-Report-Streamlit

This script is a web app using the Streamlit library that performs linear regression analysis on a sample of data from an excel file to predict the number of NB and RW applications based on the number of quotes selected by the user. The user can choose the number of quotes to sample using a slider. 

The script then trains and fits two linear regression models, one for NB applications and one for RW applications, using the selected quotes as the independent variable and the respective applications as the dependent variable. The accuracy of each model is also displayed. 

Finally, the predicted values for both NB and RW applications are displayed and added to a scatter plot along with the original data for visual representation.
